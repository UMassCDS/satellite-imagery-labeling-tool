# Developer's Guide

## Local Development
This project uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to run development servers and build packages for [a web app](https://parceljs.org/getting-started/webapp/). The following instructions detail how to use Parcel with npm for this project.

### Dependencies
For development on the Spatial Labeling tool, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the [Node Package Manager (npm)](https://docs.npmjs.com/) by following the [installation instructions in the npm Docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

### Installation
From the root of this repository, run `npm install` from the console.

### Development Server
You can start a development server at localhost:1234 by running `npm start`.

### Bundle for Web Server
To bundle and optimize code for production, run `npm run build`, which packages optimized code for a web server, creating the files in a `dist` folder. The files in `dist` are ready to be hosted on a simple web server.

### Cleaning
If you change the Parcel or Node configurations, you may want to clean up artifacts by running `npm run clean` to remove the `dist` and `.parcel-cache` folders.

## Using Docker Containers for the Application
With a Docker container, you can use pre-built code to run the application, so you don't need to worry about installing versions of Node.js or npm or running your own web server.

If you would like to use Docker images and containers to run this application, you should install either [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) or [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) to get the Docker Command Line Interface.

For a more thorough explanation of working with Node.js projects using Docker, see [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/language/nodejs/run-containers/).

### Build Image from Source Code
The `Dockerfile` in the root of this repository defines how to build and run the web application in a container. To build a Docker image named `staellite-imagery-labeling-tool` using the source code in this repository, navigate to the same folder as the `Dockerfile`, then run `docker build --tag satellite-imagery-tool .`. This will create an image named `satellite-imagery-tool` and automatically tagged as `latest`.
When you run this command, you should see several steps followed by a success message with the image ID and name:
```
$ docker build --tag satellite-imagery-labeling-tool .

```

You can see the image you created by running `docker image ls`:
```
$ docker image ls

```

### Pull a Pre-built from DockerHub
TODO: Instructions here after docker hub is set up

### Run Container
Once you have built or pulled your desired image, you can run it in a container.

Because the application in the container will be exposed on port 1234, we need to publish the container's 1234 port to a port on our host machine using the `-p` flag. Here we will publish to port 3000. See [this article](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/blog/docker-expose-port/) for a detailed description on working with ports. We will use the `-d` flag to start a container in "detached mode", so the only output will be the container id.
```
$ docker run -d -p 3000:1234 satellite-imagery-labeling-tool
bf5d560a8cf5a70a85c372ad5218a39c78867b8fe165b0fa2194b995682feca8
```

Your application will now be available by opening http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

You can see which containers are currently running and their ports using the `docker ps` command:
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                             COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                                       NAMES
bf5d560a8cf5   satellite-imagery-labeling-tool   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:3000->1234/tcp, :::3000->1234/tcp   admiring_northcutt
```

Once you're finished with the application, stop it by running `docker stop <your container id>`.
